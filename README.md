# Personal Windows 11 Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide will be updated whenever I make significant changes to settings. I am not liable for any damage that may occur to your system; these steps worked for me without issue, but results may vary depending on your system. Additionally, any configuration files for a program will be located in the file tree. I also want to add, I have tried many optimizations and over the years I came to the conclusion that over-doing it will break your system, its better to keep it simple.

> [!NOTE]
> These may not work on all systems as they vary depending on many factors like the system,router,etc.

### The first thing to do is reset your network with the following commands or download and run the bat file:

```
netsh winsock reset
netsh int ip reset all
netsh winhttp reset proxy
ipconfig /flushdns
```
### or
- [Download network-reset.bat](https://github.com/Ashur-D/Personal-Windows11-Guide/blob/main/network-reset.bat)

### next 
Run this command to see your current network congestion and take not incase you may want revert back: 
```
Get-NetTCPSetting | Select SettingName, CongestionProvider
```
- Then use 1 of the following and test out which gives the best output

```
netsh int tcp set supplemental Template=Internet CongestionProvider=bbr2
netsh int tcp set supplemental Template=Datacenter CongestionProvider=bbr2
netsh int tcp set supplemental Template=Compat CongestionProvider=bbr2
