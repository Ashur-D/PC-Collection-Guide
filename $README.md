netsh winhttp reset proxy
ipconfig /flushdns
```
### or
- [Download network-reset.bat](https://github.com/Ashur-D/Personal-Windows11-Guide/blob/main/network-reset.bat)

### next 
Run this command to see your current network congestion and take not incase you may want revert back: 
```
Get-NetTCPSetting | Select SettingName, CongestionProvider
```
- Then use 1 of the following and test out which gives the best output

```
netsh int tcp set supplemental Template=Internet CongestionProvider=bbr2
